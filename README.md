To validate that it works, you need:
- launched local web server
- clone the project to your server
- inside the project you need to execute `composer install` command (I decided to use composer for autoloading classes)
- then you may open your web browser and go to `http://your-server/auction/tests/AuctionTest.php`
- as a result, you should see, that test was successfull
